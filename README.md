# AICodeSample
The "viappleDecisionMaker" (built using IntelliJ) is an ongoing project. It is novel and should be treated as private and confidential. I present the whole folder so that it can be imported into an IDE if need be for inspection. The code is a novel version of Coupled Hidden Markov Model for decision making in situation involving different layers of interacting factors that informs ones choice. It is to be integrated into VIAPPL (see www.viappl.org ).

The Old project folder contains the .jar files of two mini projects i have done. Just for a quick testing purpose, the .jar file can be double cliked to run and see what the project looked like. One need to have jave installed. If the source coke is required, I will send it through
